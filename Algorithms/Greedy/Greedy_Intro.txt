This method is used for solving Optimization problems.

Optimization problem is the problem which demands either minimum results or maximum results.

A solution which is satisfying the constraint is feasible solution.

A solution which is already feasible and giving best result is optimal solution.

Every problem has only one optimal solution.

Greedy method is used for solving optimization problem.

Greedy Method:

1: Greedy Method
2: Dynamic Programming
3: Branch and Bound


 
Greedy Method says a problem should be solved in stages.

Greedy method says, we consider input in stages and if it is feasible we include in feasible solution list. That way we will get the optimal solution.
